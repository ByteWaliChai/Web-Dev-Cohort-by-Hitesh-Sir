## Objective and Purposre
The goal is to start a Car Wash Service in Patna that is easy to find, affordable, and trustworthy, especially for people who face difficulty locating nearby car washing options or booking reliable services.

## Problem Statement
People in Patna face several challenges when it comes to car washing:

1. **No Central Information Source** - Most car wash shops are local and not listed online. People don’t know where they are located.
2. **Unorganized Service** - Many places are roadside setup with unclean pricing and service quality.
3. **Traffic and Accessibility** - Busy areas like Boring Road, Kankarbagh, and Bailey Road make it hard to reach reliable shops.
4. **Lack of Transparency** - Customers are unsure what service are offered (e.g., inside cleaning, pressure wash, etc.)
5. **No Easy Booking or Timings Info** - Shops don't share their open hours, causing confusion.

## Scope
- Simple web page structure using only HTML
- About section (Why this car wash exists)
- Services offered
- Pricing table
- Contact section
- Location address
- Basic layout using only headings, paragraphs, and lists

### Out of Scope
- Online booking form

## Target Audience
- Car owners living in or visiting Patna city
- Working professionals who need quick and reliable services
- Families looking for clean and hygienic vehicle options
- Taxi drivers and delivery vehicle owners

## Features or Content Required on HTML Website
The website should be clear, readable, and easily understood —

### ➤ Homepage Content Plan:
1. **Heading** – Shop name and tagline

2. **About Us Section** – What is QuickShine, why it was started in Patna

3. **Our Services** – A list of services (simple list format)

4. **Pricing Table** – Use `<table>` in HTML for price transparency

5. **Why Choose Us (Local Benefits)** – Bullet points

6. **Opening Hours** – Use `<ul>` for each day and timing

7. **Contact Details** – Phone number, address, email

8. **Map Note** – Mention nearest landmark since maps can't be embedded

9. **Customer Note** – Basic do's and don’ts before visit
