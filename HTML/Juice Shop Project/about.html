      <h2>Our Roots, Our Sip</h2>
      <p>FreshSip started in Patna with one simple thought — give people a clean, fresh, and healthy alternative to carbonated cold drinks.</p>

      <p>We are a local Patna-based juice brand that believes in using fresh fruits from Bihar itself — like mangoes from Muzaffarpur, litchis from Vaishali, and sugarcane from local farms. Every drink is made right when you order — no chemicals, no preservatives.</p>

      <p>Cleanliness is our top priority. Our shop is cleaned every day, fruits are washed and cut freshly, and we only use mineral water to prepare juices.</p>

      <p>We proudly call ourselves a <strong>“Bihari Brand”</strong>, growing one sip at a time with your love.</p>
