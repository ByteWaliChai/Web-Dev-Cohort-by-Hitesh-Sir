**Location**: Patna Bihar

**Prepared for**: HTML-Only

## Problem Statement
People in Patna often face multiple problems while finding a salon:
1. **Lack of Online Presence** – Most local salons are not listed on Google or social media.
2. **Gender-Specific Spaces** – Many salons don’t clearly mention if they serve men, women, or both.
3. **Crowded Waiting Time** – People go without knowing the best time to visit, leading to long waits.
4. **Hidden Charges or Miscommunication** – Services and prices are not always clear or consistent.
6. **Inaccessibility** – Newcomers to Patna don’t know nearby salons or their services.
7. **Low Hygiene Transparency** – Customers want to know about cleanliness standards post-COVID.
